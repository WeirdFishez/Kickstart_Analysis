# Kickstart_Analysis
Excel Project for Bootcamp Module 1

Summary
This projects ultimate goal was to analyze fundraising data and provide a simplified breakdown of trends  that had correlation with successful theatre plays.

One of the main challenges in our analysis was the broad scope of data available. In order to provide an informed decision to the customer we needed to filter down the data into the following;
	1) Plays: Filtered out from 41 different sub-categories of fundraisers
	2) Fundraising Launch Date: Broken down by month spanning across any year (2010-2017)
	3) Fundraising End Date: Broken down by month spanning across any year (2010-2017)
	4) Outcomes: Broken down into 4 different subcategories
		a. Successful: Fundraiser able to meet or succeed donation goal by deadline.
		b. Failed: Fundraiser unable to hit donation goal by deadline
		c. Cancelled: Fundraiser abandoned due to non-monetary factors.
		d. Live: Fundraisers still in progress

Conclusion #1: Timing of the fundraising launch date had a clear correlation with the chances of success. Plays with launch dates in the month of May had both the highest number of successful plays along with the highest chances of a successful outcome. The month of May saw 111 successes out of 166 total. This gave May a 67% success rate vs an average of 61% across all months. (see fig. Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch)

Conclusion #2: The fundraising goal was also an important factor in a successful outcome. Fundraisers with a goal of less than $1000 had the highest success rate with 76% success vs an average of 46% across all bands. However, fundraisers with goals between $35000 to $45000 saw a unique success rate of 67%. (see fig. Outcomes_vs_Goals)

Primary Recommendation: My expert recommendation would be a play begin its fundraising in the month of May and keep the donation goal less than 1000 for best chances of success.

Secondary Recommendation: If a budget of $1,000 is not feasible for the type or play the customer is trying to put on, we recommend that they still keep the launch date in May but have the option to increase fundraising goals to $35000-$45000 at the cost of a 9% increase failure risk.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107438816/176314532-8e01d4cf-976d-4a8b-9c0c-687e2b102477.png)
